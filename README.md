A to_do_list app with HTML, SASS / CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. Our to_do_list web app will be responsive with mobile first in mind. The to_do_list app will also be built with accessibility (A11y) in mind for keyboard navigation and screen readers. We will also use the Web Storage API to create a persistent data store so our list items reappear any time we visit the web app.
